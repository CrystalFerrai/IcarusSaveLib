# Icarus Save File Serialization Library

This is a .NET library for reading and writing save files related to the game Icarus.

## Releases

There are no releases of this library at this time nor are any planned any time soon.

## How to Build

1. Clone the repo, including submodules.
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/CrystalFerrai/IcarusSaveLib.git
    ```
2. Open the file `IcarusSaveLib.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Right click the solution in the Solution Explorer panel and select "Restore NuGet Dependencies".
4. Build the solution.

## How to Use

Currently this library only supports serialization of prospect save files via the `ProspectSave` class. Other save file types may be added in the future.

## Support

This is just one of my many free time projects. No support or documentation is offered for this library beyond this readme.
